Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform that helps access
high-performance computing resources for processing and analyzing large
geospatial datasets [(Noel Golerick et
al.,2017).](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717302900)

### ðŸ”´ **2. What is cptcity and why ?**

Cptcity is a solium platform where you can find multiple colour palettes
for various themes related to cartography, technical illustration and
design. The archive supports various formats and is organised by author.
Cptcity currently has colour palettes for the most popular desktop
Geographic Information Systems such as **QGIS**, **GRASS** , **SAGA** ,
**ARCGIS** , and others. Currently, it has **7000 colour palettes**,
however in this second version of ee-cptcity module more than **300**
colour palettes were incorporated along with 2 popular palettes like
**rocket** , **mako** and **turbe**.
